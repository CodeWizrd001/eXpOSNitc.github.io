\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% one page only ??
New portable computation intensive products like notebook computers and cellular phones require high speed, yet low energy consumption.  An extensive literature survey of existing cache configurations show a trend for improving performance(average access time) at the cost of power consumption.  Three critical parameters for caches have been identified as access time, power consumption and miss rate.  A classification of existing cache configurations on the above parameters has been carried out.  A simulation technique for measuring energy consumption has been developed.  A new design to improve energy consumption using two levels of tag check has been developed.  The hypothesis is that due to spatial locality of working set~--- the number of matches in first level of tag check will be small, hence bits activated will be less thus energy consumption will be low.  Preliminary results corroborate our hypothesis.

A successful project is a fruitful culmination of efforts by many people, some directly involved and some others indirectly, by providing support and encouragement.  I express my sincere gratitude to everyone who had helped me in completing the undertaken project successfully.

Foremost, I would like to thank \textbf {Dr.~M.~N.~Neelakantan}, Visiting Professor, Deprtment of Computer Engineering(COED), National Institute of Technology, Calicut(NITC), for his invaluable suggestions at the time of midterm project review.

I would like to thank \textbf {Dr.~V.~K.~Govindan}, Professor \& Head of the Department, COED, NITC, for his constant support and encouragement throughout the project.

I would like to thank \textbf {Dr.~M.~P.~Sebastian}, Assistant Professor \& Staff in-charge, Main Computer Center, COED, NITC, for his immense help in providing all the resources and facilities.

With a profound sense of gratitude, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to my project guide \textbf {Ms.~Priya Chandran}, Assistant Professor, COED, NITC, for her expert guidance, cooperation and immense encouragement.  I am highly indebted to her for her commendable support and evincing keen interest in this project.  Without her support, I could have not moved a step forward.

Last but not least, I also extend my thanks to the entire faculty and staff of the Department of Computer Engineering, NITC, who has encouraged me throughout the course of my Masters' Degree.

I also express my thanks to my friends, for their support and encouragement in the successful completion of this project work.\par
