  This project aims to modify and update the XOS Educational Operating System [1]  by
\begin{itemize}
\item Re-engineering the eXpFS system. 
\item Including inter process communication
\item Redesigning process model 
\item Introducing shared memory model 
\item Adding more system calls thus broadening the features
\end {itemize}
The updated version is named as eXpOS/Experimental Operating System. 
Thus, adding the above features, allows eXpOS to be more instructive and informative educational tool than XOS.
