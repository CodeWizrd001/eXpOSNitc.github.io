    eXpOS or eXperimental Operating System is a tiny multiprogramming operating system. It has a very simple specification that allows a junior undergraduate computer science student to implement it in a few months, subject to availability of adequate hardware and programming platform support. It is also an instructional tool to learn and implement OS data structures and functionalities on a simulated machine called XSM (eXperimental String Machine).
