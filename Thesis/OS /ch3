\chapter{Problem Definition}
Evaluating the performance for various routing algorithms for
Publsih/Suscribe systems on a simulator and comparing the
results.Improving the performance of one of the routing algorithms
in terms of scalability,fault tolerance in a more realistic
environment (underlay awareness).
