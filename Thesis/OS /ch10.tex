\chapter{Work Done}
\label{chap10}
\begin {itemize}
\item The existing OS data structures were redesigned to incorporate the changes done. 
\item New data structures like Buffer Table, Disk Status Table, Semaphore Table, System Status Table etc were designed.
\item System calls were redesigned to incorporate asynchronous operations, buffer cache and pre-emptive scheduling.
\item Directory structure was introduced in eXpFS.
\item Executable file format was designed.
\item Algorithms for system calls and other interrupt handlers were designed.
\item Webpage for Project eXpOS was created. \texttt{$http://exposnitc.github.io/$}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Future Work}
\label{chap11}
\begin {itemize}
\item Building a Roadmap for guidance.
\item Implementing and testing the algorithms designed
\item Adding more features like file permissions and Super-User previleges.
\item Adding Multi-Threading feature.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap12}
This project aims to create a simpler version of an operating system which allows students to acquire insight into the working of a real operating system.
