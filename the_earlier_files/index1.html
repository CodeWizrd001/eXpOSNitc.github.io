 <h1> Experimental Operating System Documents </h1>
 <div> <h3>Who should read this document?   </h3>
 <p>
This document must be read by anyone wishing to write eXpOS application programs in a high level language or assembly language.  This OS specification is prepared in a programming language and target machine independent manner.  
</p>
<p>
The document is also informative for system programmers like compiler designers who wishes to write the application programmer's interface for a high level language like APL (link) to be run on eXpOS.  The application binary interface [LINK] is the must-read document for the compiler designer.  
</p>
<p>
Finally, this document must be read by anyone who wants to implement eXpOS on some machine because one needs to know the specification for the OS before getting started with its implementation!

<div><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
	This document gives application programmer's documentation for the eXperimental Operating  System (eXpOS). 
	</p> 
	<p>
<b>eXpOS </b> is a tiny multiprogramming operating system.  It has a very simple specification that allows a junior undergraduate computer science student to implement it in a few months, subject to availability of adequate hardware and programming platform support.  
</p>
<p>
This specification is prepared from the perspective of the user/application programmer and is not hardware specific.   Assumptions about the underlying hardware features necessary for the operating system to work are discussed in the first section of this document.  
</p>
</div>
<div><p>This document is divided into the following sections. 
<ul style="list-style-type:disc"> 
<li><a href="overview.html">Section 1 </a> provides an overview of the system.  </li>
<li> <a href="eXpOS_abstractions.html">Section 2</a> discusses the fundamental abstractions provided by the OS. </li>
<li> <a href="eXpfs.html">Section 3 </a> describes the logical file system of eXpOS called the Experimental File System (XFS), the various types of files supported by XFS and the operations on files. </li>  
<li> <a href="processModel.html">Section 4</a> describes the structure of eXpOS processes and the operations on processes.    This section also discusses the special processes INIT and the shell.</li>  
<li> <a href="Synchronization.html">Section 5 </a>describes the mechanisms for handling synchronization and resource access control  (necessary when processes execute concurrently).  </li>
<li> <a href="miscellaneous.html">Section 6 </a>is a "miscellaneous" section that discusses special processes/routines like the INIT process, the shell, the scheduler, the exception handler, I/O and disk devices and handlers etc. </li>
<li> <a href="SystemCallInterface.html">Section 7</a> provides a detailed specification of the application programmer's system call interface. </li>
 </ul>
