	<h1> Scheduler, Exception Handler and Device Interface</h1>
	<p>Parts of the OS specification which does not fit into other sections of this documentation has been collected here.  The topics discussed here are internal to the operating system, but part of the OS specification.  Some of these details are hidden from application/system programs and have more hardware dependency than most other parts of this documentation.</p>  
     <p>When the machine is powered on, the system is configured to start executing a ROM code in privileged mode.  This code is called the <b>bootstrap loader. </b>This ROM code loads the first block of the disk into a pre-defined area in memory and transfers control to the new loaded code.  This code is called the <b>OS startup code. </b> </p>  
     <p>The OS startup code loads the system call routines into memory and sets up the system call interrupt handlers.  In addition to these, there are three special modules that are to be loaded</p>
     <ol>
		 <li>The timer interrupt handler </li>
		 <li>The exception handler(s) </li>
		 <li>Device interrupt handler(s) </li> 
     </ol>
     <h2>Timer interrupt handler</h2>
     <p>The hardware requirement specification for eXpOS assumes that the machine is equipped with a timer device that sends periodic hardware interrupts.  The OS <b>scheduler </b>is invoked by the hardware timer interrupt handler.     eXpOS specification suggest that a <b>co-operative multitasking round robin scheduling [Wiki LINK]  </b>is employed.  This means that a round robin scheduling is employed, but a process may go to <b>sleep </b>inside a system call when:</p>
     <ol>
		 <li>The resource which the process is trying to access (like a file or semaphore) is locked by another process or (even internally locked by another OS system call in concurrent execution).   </li>
		 <li>There is a disk or I/O device access in a system call which is slow.  If wait for the device access is to be avoided, there must be hardware support from the device to send a hardware interrupt upon completion of the device operation so that the OS can put the process on sleep for now, continue scheduling the remaining processes in round robin fashion and then wake up the sleeping process when the device sends the interrupt.  Such hardware support is desirable, but not necessary to implement eXpOS.  </li> 
     </ol>
     
     <h2>Exception handler</h2>
     <p>If a process generates an illegal instruction, generates an invalid address (outside its virtual address space) or do a division by zero (or other faulty conditions which are machine dependent), the machine will generate an exception.  The exception handler must terminate the process, wake up all processes waiting for it (or resources locked by it) and invoke the scheduler to continue round robin scheduling the remaining processes.</p>   
     <p>The <b>swapper </b>module which handles <b>demand paging </b>(if the machine hardware supports demand paging) is invoked by the exception handler when there is a <b>page fault. </b> eXpOS  specification does not require implementation of demand paging.  However, most machines are equipped with hardware support for demand paging and using the feature can improve machine throughput considerably.      A discussion of demand paging is given <a href="DemandPaging.html">here</a></p>
  
     <h2>Device Handlers</h2>
     <p>eXpOS treats the disk as a special <b>block device </b>and assumes that the hardware provides <b>block transfer instructions </b>to transfer a disk blocks to memory (pages) and back.  The details are hardware specific and not part of the OS specification.  The OS system call routines are required to do the interface with the disk device drivers or low level disk routines for handling these. </p>
     <p>All other data handling devices (other than the disk) are treated as <b>stream devices. </b> This means that each device allows transfer of only one word from memory to the device or back at a time.  Some devices may permit only write (like a printer) whereas some devices may permit only read.  It is assumed that for each device there are associated low level driver routines that that can be invoked by the OS to transfer words.  The low level details are hardware specific and are to be handled by the OS routines in an implementation specific way.  Here we are concerned about the device interface to application programmers.  </p>
     <p>For each device part of the hardware, the OS assigns a unique device identifier (<b>devid</b>) which is announced to the application programmer.  (The device identifiers are specific to the particular installation).  It is assumed that device identifiers are distinguishable from file handles.     A user program can write a word into a device using the <b>write </b>system call.   The <b>read </b>system call is used when the device allows a word to be read. <a href="SystemCallInterface.html">(System Call Interface)</a></p>

 
    
The <b>standard input </b>and the <b>standard output </b>are two special stream devices with predefined identifiers XOS_STDIN and XOS_STDOUT.  Standard output only permits <b>write </b>and standard input only permits <b>read. </b>
