make a new page for special process (shell process)/* init process descrption */
idle process also..

producer consumer problem can be done /*write it in the diary*/
actually what we wanted was the file pointer being shared /*write it in the diary*/

add shutdown somewhere 


PROBLEM: if a process was in WAIT_PROCESS state and it got swapped out. then 
when it is swapped in, it will no longer wait for the other process.
Solution: Create a new Swapped_Wait state 
In signal : Swapped_wait to Swapped
System Status table has to be updated


exit -> wait and signal
