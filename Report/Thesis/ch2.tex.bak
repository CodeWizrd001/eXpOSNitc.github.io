\section{Experimental Setup}

The Performance evaluation of the algorithms is done on a simulator.
The simulator is developed in Java.
\paragraph{
The simulator allows the user to create a logical network with nodes
and links. The links are of one of the three types( secure
,urgent,normal).The simulation of the network is done by simulation
events.( node,link addition and failures,messages).The simulation
module contains the classes which processes the simulation events.
Each event is processed as a separate thread. the events are
processed in the order of the global time stamp which is attached to
each event.}
\paragraph{ The logical network module implements the
functionality of the logical node and logical link. This module
contains several interfaces which allows different implementations
of nodes and links.Routing is also a part of logical network
module.The routing Interface provides the flexibility to define
different routing algorithms.With each broker node zero or more
clients can be associated. EventBroker and EventClient modules
define the respective functionalities.The clients can have two kinds
of roles either a publishing role or a subscribing role. The roles
module defines these roles. The subscriptions are specified as the
filter (Expression on the attributes of the Publishing event).The
applnEvents contains the classes that process the filters and checks
for matches.Finally the evaluation module measures the performance
in terms of routing table size, node processing load and data
traffic and control traffic.}
