                <h2>eXpOS Philosophy</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Any pedagogical operating system project offered as part of an undergraduate junior level operating system course needs to satisfy two requirements:</p>
               
		<p>1. The student must be given as much depth and detail as possible about the central operating system concepts.</p>

		<p>2. The quantity of work involved must not exceed what a student is able to do in a typically four month semester.</p>
			
		<p>The problem before the teacher is to decide on how much compromise on (1) must be done in favour of (2). eXpOS is our stance in this matter.</p> 
		<p>There are three central principles that have been kept in mind in designing the eXpOS educational tool:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) “Separation of concerns” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra" target="_blank">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a></p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) “Things shall be made as simple as possible, but no simpler” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a></p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) “Build to learn” rather than “learn to build.”</p>
		<p>These thoughts have translated into the following decisions:</p>
		<p>1. Keep the upward and downward interfaces of the OS kernel idealistically simple – This means:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The architecture platform on which the OS is implemented is kept easy to understand and program, yet capable of supporting virtual memory, interrupt driven disk/IO, timesharing, exception handling, demand paging etc.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The application programming interface (<a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/os_spec.html#collapse1" target="_blank">API</a>) (and the application binary interface <a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/abi.html" target="_blank"> ­ABI </a>)  provided by the OS is simple to comprehend and easy to implement. Yet any interesting application is “in principle” programmable.</p>
		<p>The resultant system may not be appreciated either by a serious architecutre designer or an application programmer. Our concern here is different.</p>
		<p>2. The OS specification has been kept as simple as possible from the view point of the OS programmer. Yet it is powerful enough to be interesting. For instance, the system supports multi-tasking; there is a functional file system and processes can create, write, read and delete data files; processes can share files and memory; there is support for interprocess communication and process sychronization; the system permits mulitple users; there is support for shared library; the OS supports virtual memory and so on.</p>
		<p>3. The OS code has to be completely written by the student with no built-in code given, except a bootstrap ROM code. The programming support has been kept deliberately minimal to avoid high level programming tools hiding too many low level issues from the OS programmer.Essentially, the project requires the student to do “low level programming” on a “high level” hardware, which we believe will be instructionally useful for the student to do once.</p>
		<p>4. The goal of the system is to help the student appreciate the functioning of a “sufficiently complex” operating system and not to help him/her gain experience with “real” operating systems programming. The architecture, the OS, the API, ABI etc. are all different from any of the existing “real” systems in use, but designed to make the task of programming the OS as simple as possible.</p>
		<p>Since the operating system kernel is a software that forms a layer between the hardware and the application program, the first major hurdle that a student faces while trying to write an OS is in understanding the complexities of the underlying hardware.</p>
		<p>The eXpOS package simplifies this by providing an extremely simple­-to-­program hardware simulation – the <a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/support_tools-files/xsm-simulator.html" target="_blank">XSM</a> machine. What makes XSM simple is that its memory words can store an arbitrary string or a number. This means that data formatting – one of the major technicalities while working with machines ­ is simplified. Further simplifications include the assumption that each disk block fits into exactly one memory page etc. The OS code can be written by programming the machine using a simple-to-learn <a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/support_tools-files/spl.html" target="_blank">SPL</a> language (which is just an extended assembler for the XSM hardware).</p>
		<p>The second interface an OS has is its upward interface – the interface to application programs.This interface, called the application binary interface (<a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/abi.html" target="_blank"> ­ABI </a>), defines the low level system call interface between the application and the OS as well as the format of executable files. We keep the ABI also very simple. It is easy to load executable files into the memory, though only small programs are permitted. Parameter passing between applications and the system calls is also made extremely simple. The resultant system calls are functionally adequate, but not extensive.</p>
		<p>The eXpOS ABI is too primitive to support application programs in the C programming language. Hence we provide a seperate language (called <a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/support_tools-files/expl.html" target="_blank">ExpL</a>) using which applications can be created and compiled. The ExpL compiler given to the student supports the eXpOS high level application program interface (<a href="http://exposnitc.github.io/os_spec.html#collapse1" target="_blank">API</a>). We note here that, implementing an ExpL compiler for the eXpOS ABI on the XSM machine would be an instructive exercise for an undergraduate compiler design laboratory.</p>
		<p>We are of the view that insisting the student to work with real systems diverts his/her attention to the details of various “formats, standards and interfaces.” This often comes in the way of appreciating the underlying principles of OS design. eXpOS tries to avoid such a de­tour.</p>
		<p>Even as we tried to ensure that the heart of the subject matter is not lost, there has been several compromises. For instance, device handling is not dealt with. We believe that device interfaces are better learned using “real systems”. The multi­user support and the file system are rather primitive. Address space of a process is small and cannot expand at run time etc. Going further  into these difficulties would make it difficult for the project to be completed in a semester. These extensions are not “in principle” hard,  once the basic OS is built. However, topics such as pre-emptive multitasking, fault tolerence, system security etc. are beyond the scope of this project.</p>
		<p>It is our belief that the experiment does take the student for a useful journey through the central ideas in implementing a multitasking OS ­ including process management, memory management, file management, inter­process communication, process sychronization, demand paging, handling multiple users etc. to the extent that when he/she reads more advanced concepts from text books, his/her understanding of the new concepts will be much better than what would be without doing the project. An appreciation for the Operating System's hardware interface, application interface and run time library linkage is also intended.</p>
		<p>The project presumes that the student has undergone a basic sophomore course in computer organization and data structures. It is assumed that student is unlikely to be familar with the principles of compilers. It is also not expected that the student has a high level of proficiency in programming or computer hardware. The required background on paging hardware, interrupts, run­time stack of application programs etc. are provided as reading material at appropriate places in the project roadmap. The parameter passing convention of ExpL as well as the system call interface are pretty simple so that students will have no serious difficulty in extracting parameters inside system calls and sending back return values to the application, despite not having undergone a compiler design course.</p>
		<p>eXpOS evolved from an earlier version (called <a href="http://xosnitc.github.io/" target="_blank">XOS</a>) which was successfully used for undergraduate instruction at the department of Computer Science and Engineering, NIT Calicut. eXpOS extends XOS with multi­user support, co­operative multi­tasking, interrupt based disk transfer and interprocess communication facility. Both these platforms were developed by teams of undergraduate CSE students of NIT Calicut through a series of undergraduate major projects. Maintenance and user support for the system are being provided by a team of volunteers through a user's mailing list.</p>
