                 <br>
		<br>
		
                <p>This FAQ is about the educational package involving the eXpOS operating sytem and its supporting tools – the XSM machine simulator, the XFS-interface tool and the SPL and ExpL programming languages, collectively referred to as the "eXpOS package". </p>

				<p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse1">1. What is eXpOS? What is its purpose?</a></p>
                     <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>eXpOS stands for experimental operating system.    The <a href="os_spec.html" target="_blank">eXpOS specification</a> describes a very simple single user multi-tasking operating system. </p> 

<p>eXpOS is not intented to be used as a practical operating system.  It is designed with the following intentions:</p>

<ol style="margin-left: 90px;">
	<li>To have a multi-tasking OS specification that can be comprehended by a junior undergraduate student in computer science who is undergoing a first course in Operating System such that she/he will be able to implement the OS in two or three months.    This educational package comes with enough guidance and support tools as well as documentation to allow the student to achieve this goal without the supervision of a specialist teacher.  </li>
	<li>The student will write the complete code for the OS from scratch.  She/he will not be building the OS on top of a given code base.  The only programming support provided will be a compiler for a high level programming language in which the OS kernel will be written (called SPL).  </li>
	
</ol>

                     </div>
                     
                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse2">2. Who will benefit by implementing eXpOS?</a></p>
                     <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						<p>If you are a non-expert in computer science – like an undergraduate student or some non-specialist systems enthusiast – and you have a basic understanding of programming, and computer organization,  implementing eXpOS will help you to get a feel of some of the core ideas involved in implementing a multi-tasking operating system on a single processor.   You will learn how to:</p> 
						
						<ol style="margin-left: 90px;">
	<li>Initally load the operating system from secondary storage to memory – Bootstrapping.   </li>
	<li>Manage several processess in memory simultaniously – process management.  </li>
		<li>Handle allocation and de-allocation of memory to processes – memory management.  The memory managament includes a virtual memory implementation.  </li>
		<li>Manage organization of data and program files in secondary storage – file management.</li>
		<li>Implement a mechanism to allow multiple processes to share files/memory – resource sharing.</li>
		<li>Realize primitives that help application programs to avoid inconsitency when resources are shared by several processes executing concurrently – process sychronization.</li>
	
</ol>
<p>The experiment is akin to guiding a third year aerospace engineering student to build a small unmanned flight in two months.   (The flight will not be usable outside the laboratory!)</p>

						 <p>People who want to learn about operating systems,  but who belong to the following category are not advised to proceed with eXpOS: </p> 
						 
<ol style="margin-left: 90px;">
	<li>You are a confident programmer comfortable with reading and understanding professionally written code – like the source code of linux.   In this case, more sophisticated packages like <a href="http://minix3.org/">Minix</a> allow you to do real hard stuff.   However, this is not for novices. </li>
	<li>You are not an expert;   you want to try out the things listed in FAQ 2,  but you do not want to do dirty work at a low level.  (Although you can avoid assembly language programming in the eXpOS project, you still will have to get into quite a bit of  “low level” architectural details).   We suggest you to look for alternatives like <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tom/nachos/" target="_blank">NACHOS</a> or <a href="http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~topsy/" target="_blank">TOPSY</a>. </li>

                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse6">6. What are the important OS concepts I miss out when working with eXpOS? </a></p>
                     <div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>What you learn is very little compared to what is needed to become an OS expert.  
So, listing out everything is impossible.  But here are some important misses: </p> 

<ol style="margin-left: 90px;">
	<li>The XSM machine allows you to store a character string in a memory word.    
No real machine architecture permits you to do such stuff.  This is made possible just because XSM is a software simulated.   However,  XSM makes your data manipulation job much simpler without getting bogged down by details of data formatting.    
      It is in principle possible to implement eXpOS on “more real” machines like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set" target="_blank">MIPS</a>.  However, this would involve considerably more time and effort.  </li>
	<li>The project involves very little work involving input-ouput, device interfacing, security or networking.  Moreover the file system is a very primitive one.  </li>
		<li> The methods studied won't scale up to multi-core machines or when there is pre-emptive multitasking.   These topics are beyond the scope of the project. The multiuser support provided by eXpOS is also very primitive.  </li>

                     <div id="collapse7" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>We expect you to have a Linux/Unix Machine with Lex/Flex  and Yacc/Bison software packages installed.   (For Flex/Bison installation on your Linux system, see <a href="http://en.kioskea.net/faq/30635-how-to-install-flex-and-bison-under-ubuntu" target="_blank">link</a>).

						 <p>The eXpOS package available at [LINK****] comes with the following:  </p> 
<ol style="margin-left: 90px;">
	<li>A simulator for the Experimental String Machine (XSM)  on which you implement eXpOS.  (The XSM machine specification can be found <a href="arch_spec.html" target="_blank">here</a>).  The machine consists of a CPU, Memory and a disk (called xfs-disk) and a small Input-Ouput subsystem. </li>
	<li>A compiler (into the XSM machine) for the System Programmer's Language (SPL) using which you will be writing all your code for implementing eXpOS.   SPL is a very simple language, specifically designed for the eXpOS package.     You can see SPL specification <a href="support_tools-files/spl.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>
		<li>A compiler (into the XSM machine) for the <a href="support_tools-files/expl.html" target="_blank">Experimental String Language (ExpL)</a>.  This language is used for writing application programs that can run on top of eXpOS.  You will be using this language primarily for running test programs on your operating system.</li>
		<li>An interface tool called xfs-interface that allows you to transfer data files and executable programs from your Unix/Linux system into the hard disk of the XSM machine (called xfs-disk).  Details of xfs-interface can be found <a href="support_tools-files/xfs-interface.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  </li>
		<li>You also download the source code of all the above, sample test programs testing your your OS, the formal specification documents of all the above downloads, some help etc.  </li>

                     <div id="collapse9" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>The best way is to follow the eXpOS roadmap.  It is a journey taken one simple step at a time.  You will be provided with links to learn the concepts on a “learn when needed” way.  Just go ahead following this <a href="Roadmap.html" target="_blank">link</a>  </p> 

                     </div> 
                     
                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse10">10. What differenciates eXpOS from other educational packages like NACHOS? </a></p>
                     <div id="collapse10" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>It is difficult to answer this question for all similar packages available elsewhere, but here is a comparison with NACHOS. </p> 
						 <p>Nachos learning system asks you to implement OS software that allows application programs in the noff executable format, running on a the software simulation of a MIPS machine, to invoke system calls.   However, the OS code you write really doesn't run on the MIPS machine!  Your code is actually C code running on your Linux/Unix machine.  When an application program invokes an OS system call, the MIPS simulator transfers control to a corresponding “stub” function 
in the simulating environment.    You must write C code in the stub to do “whatever is expected
from the OS” to satisfy the calling application program invoking the system call.   Since the MIPS machine is simulated, your code has access to its memory, registers etc.  Thus you can implement the system call, put return values in appropriate memory locations on the simulated MIPS machine and transfer control back to the calling program.  </p>
<p>In eXpOS, the OS and the application programs run in the same machine as is the case in real systems.  The compromise made in achieving this goal was to make the machine “unreal” and the OS  simple enough so that additional complexity is manageable for a short term project.   </p>


                     </div> 
                     
                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse11">11. What is the difference between eXpOS and XOS? </a></p>
                     <div id="collapse11" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p><a href="http://xosnitc.github.io/" target="_blank">XOS</a> is an earlier version of this project.  XOS did not support blocking system calls.
						 <p> This means that a process will never do a context switch while it is running in the kernel mode. However eXpOS, system calls may block in the kernel mode and other processes could be scheduled.  The version of XSM provided with eXpOS has the necessary hardware support for doing this. 
						 </p>
						 <p> The addition of this single feature makes the eXpOS substantially more complex that XOS.
This is because a blocked process might have made partial updates to some OS data structures before blocking and a newly scheduled process, while executing in the kernel mode, must be careful not to modify these data structures and leave the OS in an inconsistent state. 
						</p>
						<p> Apart from the above feature, eXpOS adds support for semaphores, shared memory, file locking etc. There is also limited multiuser support.  However, the additional complexity introduced by these features is minor. </p> 

                     </div> 
                     
                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse12">12. How do I write OS code and load the OS in the eXpOS system? </a></p>
                     <div id="collapse12" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>You have to write your OS code from your Linux/Unix system in a custom programming language called SPL that comes with the eXpOS package, compile the code and install the target code into the hard disk of the XSM machine.  The xfs-interface tool allows you to do this pre-loading.   Your OS code must include set up code that will be executed when the system is started.  This code must load the rest of the OS into memory during bootstrap. </p> 

                     </div> 
                     
                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse13">13. How do I write application programs that run on eXpOS?</a></p>
                     <div id="collapse13" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>Application programs must be  compiled in the Linux/Unix environment outside and pre-loaded into the XSM machine's disk.  The ExpL language allows applications to be written and compiled into the eXpOS executable format called the XEXE format.   eXpOS does provide system calls that can be invoked from application programs to create and manipulate data files.  </p> 

                     </div> 
                     
                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse14">14. What is meant by user mode and kernel mode?  </a></p>
                     <div id="collapse14" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>In a multitasking OS like Linux, there are two types of programs running.  One set are application programs that users write called "user mode programs".  The other are "kernel mode" programs.  This is actually the OS code itself.    These routines implement the system call interface for application programs and other OS functions like process, memory, file and device management etc. </p> 
<p>User mode programs can execute only a restricted instruction set and has access only to a limited memory (called the virtual address space).  These programs must invoke OS system calls to do tasks which involve capacity beyond their limited instruction set.   Kernel mode programs on the other hand have full access to the machine instruction set. </p>
<p>Any machine supporting eXpOS needs to recognize and support two modes of program execution.  The OS must be designed such that the machine switches to kernel mode when a user mode program invokes a system call and goes back to user mode when the system call returns.  This requires architecture support.  XSM machine is equipped with the necessary hardware support. </p> 

 
                     </div> 
                     
                     <p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse15">15. Why do you need two programming languages in the eXpOS package – the SPL and ExpL?  </a></p>
                     <div id="collapse15" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>We need seperate programming systems for writing user mode programs and kernel mode programs because the machine model (instruction set, accessible memory etc.) are different for both the modes.  (See previous FAQ).   ExpL language is designed for writing user mode programs and SPL is designed for writing kernel mode programs for eXpOS.

                     <div id="collapse16" class="panel-collapse collapse">
						 <p>You must write your code in ExpL language in your Unix/Linux machine, compile it using the ExpL compiler that comes with the eXpOS package and load the target executable file into the XSM machine's disk using the xfs-interface tool.  Now start the machine (assuming that your friend has already written his OS routines in SPL, compiled it using the SPL compiler and loaded it into the disk) so that her OS boots up and runs the shell program.  From the shell, you will be able to type in the name of your executable program and execute it, just like in bash.  </p>
