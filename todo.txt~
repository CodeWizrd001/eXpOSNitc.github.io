check all links
links from expos to xsm
make a new page for special process (shell process)/* init process descrption */
idle process also..


check error codes 
link to report 

producer consumer problem can be done /*write it in the diary*/

actually what we wanted was the file pointer being shared

change the Locking PID to the file table
look at klock and ulock in read and write
check self lock everywhere 
cannot close a file that you have locked (if self lock close fails no problem with open) same problem on semrelease

in exit first unlock all files and semaphores and then close/release 



IMPORTANT
