make a new page for special process (shell process)/* init process descrption */
idle process also..

producer consumer problem can be done /*write it in the diary*/
actually what we wanted was the file pointer being shared /*write it in the diary*/

add shutdown somewhere 


PROBLEM: if a process was in WAIT_PROCESS state and it got swapped out. then 
when it is swapped in, it will no longer wait for the other process.
Solution: Create a new Swapped_Wait state 
In signal : Swapped_wait to Swapped
System Status table has to be updated


exit -> wait and signal

The mode flag in the <a href="process_table.html" target="_blank">Process Table</a> has to be set to Kernel mode when the process enters the system call and reset before exiting from the system call.

Done in all sync algos and sem algos, read, close, write, seek, getpid, getppid, exit, open, fork
