                <p>Parts of the OS specification which does not fit into other sections of this documentation has been collected here. These topics are internal to the operating system, but part of the OS specification. Some of these details are hidden from application/system programs and have more hardware dependency than most other parts of this documentation.</p>  
     <p>When the machine is powered on, the system is configured to start executing a ROM code in privileged mode. This code is called the <b>bootstrap loader</b>. This ROM code loads the first block of the disk into a pre-defined area in memory and transfers control to the newly loaded code. This code is called the <b>OS startup code</b>.  </p>  
     <p>The OS startup code loads the system call routines into memory.  These routines are loaded as <i>software interrupt handlers</i>. In addition to these, there are four hardware interrupt / exception  handler  modules that are to be loaded - <b>the timer interrupt handler, the exception handler, the disk interrupt handler and the terminal handler</b>.   If the architecture supports other devices, then the corresponding device interrupt handlers also must be loaded by the OS Startup code. This specification leaves out details regarding other device handlers.    </p>

                            <p>The hardware requirement specification for eXpOS assumes that the machine is equipped with a timer device that sends periodic hardware interrupts.  The OS <b>scheduler </b>is invoked by the hardware timer interrupt handler.     eXpOS specification suggest that a co-operative multitasking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling" target="_blank">round robin scheduling</a> is employed.  This means that a round robin scheduling is employed, but a process may go to <b>sleep </b>inside a system call when:</p>
                            <ol style="margin-left: 60px;">
		 <li>The resource which the process is trying to access (like a file or semaphore) is locked by another process (or even internally locked by another OS system call in concurrent execution).   </li>
		 <li>There is a disk or I/O device access in a system call which is slow. If the wait for the device access is to be avoided, there must be hardware support from the device to send a hardware interrupt when device operation is finished.  This allows the OS to put the process on sleep for now, continue scheduling the remaining processes in round robin fashion and then wake up the sleeping process when the device sends the interrupt. Such hardware support is desirable, but not necessary to implement eXpOS </li>

After initiating the disk-memory transfer, the block transfer routine normally returns to the calling program, which sleeps for the disk operation to complete.  </p>

                                <p>All other data handling devices (other than the disk) are treated as <b>stream devices</b>. This means that each device allows transfer of only one word from memory to the device or back at a time. Some devices may permit only write (like a printer) whereas some devices may permit only read. It is assumed that for each device there are associated <b>low level routines</b> that can be invoked by the OS to transfer data and control instructions.   Some of  these devices may raise a hardware interrupt when the transfer is complete.  Thus, for each device that raises an interrupt, there must be a corresponding device interrupt handler.   </p>
                                <p>The details of how data is transferred between memory and specific devices are hardware dependent and are to be handled by the OS routines in an implementation specific way. Here we are concerned about the device interface to application programmers. </p>
                                <p>For each device part of the hardware, the OS assigns a unique device identifier (<b>devid</b>) which is announced to the application programmer.  (The device identifiers are specific to the particular installation).  It is assumed that device identifiers are distinguishable from file handles.     A user program can write a word into a device using the <b>write </b>system call.   The <b>read </b>system call is used when the device allows a word to be read. <a href="systemcallinterface.html" target="_blank">(System Call Interface)</a>. <b>Read</b> and <b>Write</b> are the only system calls associated with devices.   </p>

     <p>    
         The <b>standard input</b> and the <b>standard output</b> are two special stream devices with predefined identifiers STDIN = -1  and STDOUT = -2. Standard output permits only <b>Write</b> and standard input permits only <b>Read</b>.  The Read operation typically puts the process executing the operation to sleep for console input from the user.   When the user inputs data, the console device must send a hardware interrupt.  The corresponding handler routine is called <b>terminal handler</b>.  The terminal handler is responsible for waking up processes that are blocked for input console. </p>

                                <p>The eXpOS library consists of a collection of high level (user level) routines.    The library is part of the OS and is loaded into the memory at the time of boostrap.   The OS loader (exec system call) links the library to the address space of a process if necessary.  The executable header contains the information required for the loader to decide whether the library must be linked to the address space of a process when it is loaded for execution.  The eXpOS library routines provide a unified interface for invoking system calls and dynamic memory management routines provided by the operating stystem.  The interface hides the details of the interrupt service routines corresponding to the system calls from the application.

The OS has an INIT program pre-loaded in the disk, which is loaded for execution at the time of bootstrap. The resulting process is the second process scheduled for execution (after the <a href="../os_design-files/misc.html#idle" target="_blank">IDLE process</a>) and is called the INIT process. The INIT program is expected to run a login program that validates a user trying to log into the system using the <i>Login</i> system call. Hence, the INIT process is also called the <b>login process</b>. A <b>shell</b> is created upon successful login and the INIT (login) process waits for the exit of the shell to log in the next user. The shell program is typically designed to repeatedly wait for user commands (executable file names) and execute them. The algorithm design for a typical login process is given <a href="../os_design-files/misc.html#login" target="_blank">here</a>.
