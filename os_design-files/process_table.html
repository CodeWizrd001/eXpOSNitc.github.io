              <p>The Process Table (PT) contains an entry for each <a href="../os_spec-files/processmodel.html" target="_blank">process</a> present in the system. The entry is created when the process is created by a Fork system call. Each entry contains several fields that stores all the information pertaining to a single process. The maximum number of entries in PT (which is maximum number of processes allowed to exist at a single point of time in eXpOS) is MAX_PROC_NUM. In the current version of eXpOS, MAX_PROC_NUM = 16.</p>
              <p>Each entry in the Process Table has a constant size, defined by the PT_ENTRY_SIZE. In this version of eXpOS, PT_ENTRY_SIZE is set to 16 words. Any entry of PT has the following fields:</p>

                          <li>(CREATED,___) – The process has been created in memory and data structures set up, but has never been scheduled. The fork system call creates the child process in CREATED state.

The disk interrupt handler changes the state from (WAIT_DISK,___) to (READY,___), after it has completed the disk transfer. </li>

                              <p>The Per-Process Page Table contains information regarding the physical location of the pages of a process. Each valid entry of a page table stores the physical page number corresponding to each logical (virtual) page associated with the process. The logical page number can vary from 0 to MAX_PROC_PAGES- 1 for each process. Therefore, each process has MAX_NUM_PAGES entries in the page table.  The address of Page Table of the currently executing process is stored in PTBR of the machine and length of the page table is stored in PTLR. In this version of eXpOS, MAX_NUM_PAGES is set to 10, hence PTLR is always set to 10.</p>
                              <p>Associated with each page table entry, typically <b>auxiliary information </b>is also stored.  This is to store information like whether the process has write permission to the page, whether the page is dirty, referenced, valid etc.   The exact details are architecture dependent.  The eXpOS specification expects that the hardware provides support for reference, valid and write bits.   (See page table structure of XSM <a href="../arch_spec-files/paging_hardware.html" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>

It is set to 0 if the entry is invalid. The OS expects the architecture to generate a page fault if any process attempts to access an invalid page.  </li>
                 <li><b>Write bit </b> - This bit is set to 1 by the OS if the page can be written and is set to 0 otherwise. The OS expects the architecture to generate an exception if any process, while running in the user mode, attempts to modify a page whose write bit is not set. </li>

                  <p><b>Note2:</b> In the eXpOS implementation on the XSM architecture, if a page is not loaded to the memory, but is stored in a disk block, the disk block number corresponding to the physical page number is stored in the <a href="#disk_map_table">disk map table</a> of the process.

                              <p>Corresponding to each user process, the kernel maintains a seperate memory region (called the user area) for its own purposes.  The present version of eXpOS allocates one memory page per process as the user area.   A part of this space is 
used to store the per process resource table of the process.  The rest of the memory is alloted for the kernel stack of the process.  

Hence in eXpOS, each process has a kernel stack in addition to user stack. We maintain a seperate stack for the kernel operations to prevent user-level "hacks" into kernel.

                              <p>Control is tranferred from a user program to a kernel module on the occurence of one of the following events : <ol>
         <li> The user program executes a system call </li>
         <li> When an interrupt/exception occurs.</li>
         </ol>
         In either case, the kernel allocates a separate stack <b>for each process </b>(called the kernel stack of the process) which is different from the stack used by the process while executing in the user mode (called the user stack).  Kernel modules use the space in the kernel stack for storing local data and do not use the user stack.  This is to avoid user "hacks" into the kernel using the application's stack.</p>
			      <p>In the case of a system call, the application will store the parameters for the system call in its user stack. Upon entering the kernel module (system call), the kernel will extract these parameters from the application's stack and then change the stack pointer to its own stack before further execution.   Since the application invokes the kernel module 
voluntarily, it is the responsibility of the application to save the contents of its registers (except the stack pointer and base pointer registers in the case of the XSM machine) before invoking the system call.</p>
			      <p>In the case of an interrupt/exception, the user process does not have control over the transfer to the kernel module (interrupt/exception handler).  Hence the execution context of the user process (that is, values of the registers) must be saved by the kernel module, before the kernel module uses the machine registers for other purposes, so that the machine state can be restored after completion of the interrupt/exception handler.  The kernel stack is used to store the execution context of the user process.  This context is restored before the return from the kernel module.  (For the implementation of eXpOS on the XSM architecture, the <a href="../arch_spec-files/instruction_set.html#backup" target="_blank">backup</a> and <a href="../arch_spec-files/instruction_set.html#restore" target="_blank">restore</a> instructions facilitate this).</p>
			      <p>In addition to the above, if a kernel module invokes another kernel module while executing a system call/interrupt, the parameters to the called module and the return values from the module are passed through the same kernel stack.</p>
