                <h2>Interrupts and Exception handling</h2>
                <br/>
                <br/>
<p>XSM supports a total of 19 interrupts.  Each interrupt is identified by its number between 0 and 18.  Among these, Interrupt 0 is the exception handler, Interrupt 1 is the timer interrupt, Interrupt 2 is the disk controller interrupt and Interrupt 3 is the console interrupt. Interrupts 1, 2 and 3 are hardware interrupts. The interrupts 4 to 18 are software interrupts.  Software interrupts occur when they are invoked by a program in execution.  A program can invoke a software interrupt using the INT machine instruction.   However, <i>hardware interrupts</i> and the <i>exception handler</i> cannot be invoked from user mode programs.</p>  

<p>Associated with each interrupt/exception, there is an interrupt handler.    When an interrupt occurs, the corresponding handler is executed.  XSM specification reserves two contiguous memory pages for loading each interrupt handler according to the table given in <a href="machine_organisation.html#content" target="_blank" >Memory Organisation</a>.  When an interrupt/exception occurs, the machine transfers control to the beginning of the first page of the corresponding handler.  It is the responsibility of the programmer to store the interrupt handler routines in the disk and load them to the corresponding pages at the time of system startup.</p>					

<br>
<h4><b>Timer Interrupt</b></h4>
<p>The XSM architecture includes a timer that can cause periodic interrupts during execution in unprivileged mode. The timer ticks with each unprivileged instruction executed and once the number of ticks reaches a threshold specified during boot-time, the tick counter is reset and a timer interrupt is raised causing execution to be transferred to the timer interrupt handler (INT1) stored in page 4-5. If the instruction that causes the timer to reach its tick threshold raises an interrupt or exception, the interrupt/exception handler corresponding to that interrupt/exception is invoked first before the timer interrupt is raised.</p>

<br>
<div id="disk_interrupt">
<h4><b>Disk Controller Interrupt</b></h4>
<p>The Disk Controller allows for imitating asynchronous disk access by the OS. The Disk Controller, upon receiving a disk access request, initiates a timer that ticks with each unprivileged instruction executed. Once the timer reaches its threshold, a value specified during boot-time, a disk interrupt (INT2) is raised and execution is passed to the disk interrupt handler in page 6. The macros 'load' and 'store' are used to send requests to the Disk Controller.</p>
</div>

<br>
<div id="console_interrupt">
<h4><b>Console Interrupt</b></h4>
<p>The XSM Architecture has a Console Device which acts as the IO interface for user interaction. When a program requires interacting with the user, the macros 'IN', 'INI' and 'OUT' are used to invoke the Console Device. Output is a synchronous process and works immediately. The console device starts a timer which ticks with each unprivileged instruction when an input is requested using the IN instruction. Once the timer reaches its threshold (specified at boot-time), an interrupt (INT3) is raised and execution is transferred to Page 8. The Console Device does not support parallel input requests. Thus it is the OS Programmer's duty to ensure that multiple requests are not raised. Control is transferred to the user program by the interrupt routine only after the user inputs a word from the Console. The INI instruction (which can be used only in debug mode) is a special instruction which allows synchronous console input where the machine doesn't raise an interrupt but waits for the user to enter the data before proceeding to the next instruction.</p>
</div>

<br>
<h4><b>Exceptions</b></h4>
<p>Exceptions are anomalous situations which changes the normal flow of execution. The machine raises an exception when it runs in <b>user mode</b> and encounters an anomalous situation during program execution like division by zero or  generation of an invalid address.   All exceptions raise Interrupt 0. A detailed discussion on various conditions leading to the machine raising an exception are discussed below.</p>  


<ul style="list-style-type: square;line-height: 25px;margin-left: 80px;font-size: 16px;">
         <li><b>Illegal Memory Access </b>- occurs when any address generated by the process lies outside its logical address space values.   This also occurs when the process tries to write into pages whose Write access bit is not set in the page table. The logical page number generated for a valid instruction should be between 0 and the value of (512 * PTLR) - 1. </li>
         <br>
         <li><b>Illegal instructions </b> - occurs when an attempt is made to execute an instruction not belonging to the instruction set or when an operand/data in an instruction is not legal. </li>
		 E.g. :-<br> 	
		 MOV 4  R0,<br>
		 MOV IP  4  , when executed in user mode.<br>
		 <br>
		 <li><b>Page Fault </b>- Occurs when the page accessed by the process is not available in the memory. (See <a href="paging_hardware.html" target="_blank" >Paging Hardware</a>)</li>
		 <br>                  
		 <li><b>Arithmetic exception </b>- Occurs when the divisor is 0. </li>
		 <br>                  
		 <!--li><b>Illegal Write </b>- Occurs when the prcoess tries to write into pages whose Write access bit is not set in the page table (See <a href="paging_hardware.html" target="_blank" >Paging Hardware</a>).</li>
		 <br-->
</ul>

	<p>When an exception occurs while the machine is executing in User mode, the machine transfers control of execution â€“ pushes the instruction pointer to user stack and changes the value of IP to page number 2 (address = 1024) where the Exception Handler Routine resides.</p>

	<p>The XSM Register set consists of five special registers for storing the details regarding exceptions. The exception Registers are as shown below</p>
<ul style="text-indent: 5em;font-size:16px;">
<li>1. <b>Exception IP (EIP)</b> : Stores the value of IP at the point where the exception occurred.</li>
<br>
<li>2. <b>Exception Page Number (EPN)</b> : This field is relevant when a Page Fault Exception occurs. The logical page number which caused a page fault exception is stored here.</li>
<br>
<li>3. <b>Exception Cause (EC)</b> : This field indicates a number which corresponds to the cause of the exception. Exceptions can be caused when the following events occur.
<ul style="text-indent: 10em;">
<br>
<li>(i). Page Fault : The value stored in the EC register for this exception is 0.</li>
<li>(ii). Illegal instruction : The value stored in the EC register for this exception is 1.</li>
<li>(iii). Illegal memory access : The value stored in the EC register for this exception is 2.</li>
<li>(iv). Arithmetic exception : The value stored in the EC register for this exception is 3.</li>
<!--li>(v). Illegal Write : The value stored in the EC register for this exception is 4.</li-->
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<!--li>4. <b>Exception Virtual Address (EVA)</b> : Exception Virtual Address register stores the virtual address which caused the exception.</li>
<br-->
<li>4. <b>Exception Memory Address (EMA)</b> : Exception Memory Address register is relevant only in the case of illegal memory access. The illegal
memory which was tried to be accessed is stored in the register. This field is relevant only when either the address referred to is outside the range 0 - 512*(PTLR-1) or a write is attempted to a page which is read-only.</li>
</ul>  
<br>
<h4><b>Software Interrupts</b></h4>
<p>Software Interrupts (traps) are the primary mechanisms by which a user mode program transfers control to the corresponding interrupt handler that runs in the kernel mode. Software interrupt service routines typically contain the OS code for various system calls. Upon return from a software interrupt using the IRET instruction, execution resumes from the next instruction in the user mode program. A total of 15 software interrupts are available (Interrupt 4 - Interrupt 18).</p>    
                  

<p>In Kernel mode, hardware interrupt (Interrupts 0, 1, 2 and 3) routines may also be invoked just like software interrupt routines. Note that user mode programs can not invoke the hardware interrupt routines.</p>
                  
<p>If a software interrupt is invoked from the kernel mode, the address of the next instruction is pushed into the 
stack and the interrupt handler is executed.  If the return from a software/hardware interrupt routine is to a program
in kernel mode, the RET instruction must be used instead of the IRET instruction to ensure that execution continues in the kernel mode upon return <a href="instruction_set.html#privileged_instruction" target="_blank" >(see instruction set)</a>.</p>
